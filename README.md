# Keeper App

A coding exercise meant to test what I've learned from the React module of the Udemy course "The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp" by Dr. Angela Yu. Inspired by the note-taking service Google Keep, the app accepts two input values - (a) title and (b) content. It then stores them in an array and maps them on display or filtered on deletion.

## What was learned from this coding exercise:
* State Hook
* ES6 Destructuring
* Mapping data to components using the map() and filter() methods
* Spread Operator
* Component Tree
* Event Handling
