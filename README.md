# Keeper App

This React project is a coding practice activity to test what I've learned from the React module of the Udemy course "The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp" by Dr. Angela Yu. It is inspired by the note=taking service Google Keep.

The app accepts two input - (a) title and (b) content. It will then store the new note in an array and mapped for display.

## What was learned from this coding exercise:
* State Hook
* ES6 Destructuring
* Mapping data to components using the map() and filter() methods
* Spread Operator
* Component Tree
* Event Handling
